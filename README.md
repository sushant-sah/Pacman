Pacman AI Search Project

This project implements several search algorithms to control Pacmanâ€™s movement through mazes.
Each algorithm explores how Pacman can efficiently reach goals, such as collecting food or visiting all corners.
The project is part of the UC Berkeley AI (CS188) framework, adapted for learning about state space search and heuristic evaluation.
